# ðŸŽ® Word Catcher â€“ Assembly Language Game

This is a **Letter Catcher** game developed by me and my friend **Abdul Moeez** as part of the *Computer Organization and Assembly Language* course in our **BSCS degree program**.  
The game is written entirely in **x86 Assembly (16-bit real mode)** and runs in a DOS text-mode environment. You control a moving box at the bottom of the screen to **catch falling characters** and avoid missing them. The game tests your reaction time and coordination while tracking your **score** and **missed characters** in real time.
